VFX effects that I created for Epic Game's Project Titan art jam. 

The Unreal Engine version we used for the event is 5.4.1. 

We were mostly been restricted to just niagara and scratchpad, so there are certain things we can't make for the event like a full blown posterization filter.
I wasn't able to create as many I hoped as I gotten busy with life and my personal game project, DeathJack, in almost all of May.
