Please note some of the effect may not work straight out of the box as it relies on some materials and meshes that were in Project Titan that were not my own.

We were mostly been restricted to just niagara and scratchpad, so there are certain things we can't make for the event like a full blown posterization filter.
I wasn't able to create as many I hoped as I gotten busy with life and my personal game project, DeathJack, in almost all of May.
